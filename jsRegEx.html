    <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
    <p>A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a <b>search pattern </b>.</p>
    <p>The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.</p>
    <p>
      A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern. Regular expressions can be used to
      perform all types of text search and text replace operations.
    </p>
    <pre>
      Syntax
      /pattern/modifiers;
      Example
      /w3schools/i;
      Example explained:

      /w3schools/i  is a regular expression.
      w3schools  is a pattern (to be used in a search).
      i is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).
    </pre>
    <h3>Using String Methods</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace().</p>
    <p>The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.</p>
    <p>The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.</p>

    <h4>Using String search() With a String</h4>
    <p>The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match:</p>
    <script>
      let text = "Visit W3Schools!";
      let n = text.search("W3Schools");
      document.write(n);
    </script>
    <h4>Using String search() With a Regular Expression</h4>
    <p>Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string:</p>
    <p>
      case insensitive means that it doesn't matter whether the word is in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. It will
      match all variations.
    </p>
    <script>
      let text2 = "Visit W3Schools";
      let n2 = text.search(/w3schools/i);
      document.write(n2);
    </script>
    <h3>Using String replace() With a String</h3>
    <p>The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:</p>
    <script>
      let myString = "Visit Microsoft!";
      let result = myString.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
      document.write(result);
    </script>
    <h3>Use String replace() With a Regular Expression</h3>
    <p>Use a case insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string:</p>
    <script>
      let textStr = "Visit Microsoft!";
      let myResult = textStr.replace(/microsoft/i, "W3Schools");
      document.write(myResult);
    </script>
    <h2>Regular Expression Modifiers</h2>
    <p>Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive more global searches:</p>
    <pre>
      i	Perform case-insensitive matching	
      g	Perform a global match (find all)	
      m	Perform multiline matching	
      d	Perform start and end matching (New in ES2022)
    </pre>
    <p>
      By default the below replace would replace only the first only replaces the first occurrence of the word, but with
      a regular expression with the g flag, It will now replace every 'string' in the line.
    </p>
    <script>
      let aString = "string in a string for string";
      let bString = aString.replace(/string/g, "text");
      console.log(bString);
    </script>
  </body>
