    <h2>API</h2>
    <p>
      API is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications or systems to communicate with each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      An API (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge that allows two software applications or systems to
      communicate with each other.
    </p>
    <p>APIs can be used to send data, retrieve data, or trigger actions in another application.</p>
    <p>Example of API in Real Lifeis >> The waiter (API) connects you (client) with the kitchen (server).</p>
    <p>
      <b>Web APIs â†’ </b> is used to communicate over the internet. Example: Fetching weather data from an API like
      OpenWeatherMap.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Web API is an API that allows communication between a client (frontend) and a server (backend) over the
      internet.
    </p>
    <!-- Example of a Web API Request (Using JavaScript Fetch)
Fetching data from a REST (Representational State Transfer) API: -->
    <script>
      fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3") // API request
        .then((response) => response.json()) // Convert response to JSON
        .then((data) => console.log(data)) // Print API response
        .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
    </script>

    <h2>Third Party APIs</h2>
    <p>Third party APIs are not built into your browser.</p>
    <p>To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web.</p>
    <pre>
        YouTube API - Allows you to display videos on a web site.
        Twitter API - Allows you to display Tweets on a web site.
        Facebook API - Allows you to display Facebook info on a web site.
    </pre>

    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Web History API</h2>
    <p>The Web History API provides easy methods to access the windows.history object.</p>
    <p>The window.history object contains the URLs (Web Sites) visited by the user.</p>

    <h2>History Object Properties/Methods</h2>
    <p><b>length property</b> Returns the number of URLs in the history list</p>
    <p>
      back() method Loads the previous URL in the history list. forward() method Loads the next URL in the history list.
      go() method Loads a specific URL from the history list.
    </p>
    <h4>History back() Method</h4>
    <p>
      The back() method loads the previous URL in the windows.history list. It is the same as clicking the "back arrow"
      in your browser.
    </p>
    <button onclick="backFun()">Go Back</button>
    <button onclick="goBackFun()">Go Back 2 Pages</button>
    <script>
      function backFun() {
        window.history.back();
      }

      function goFun() {
        window.history.go(-2);
      }
    </script>

    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Web Storage API</h2>
    <p>The Web Storage API is a simple syntax for storing and retrieving data in the browser.</p>
    <!-- Example below -->
    <script>
      localStorage.setItem("name", "Khalid Usman");
      document.write(localStorage.getItem("name"));
    </script>
    <h3>The localStorage Object</h3>
    <p>
      The localStorage object provides access to a local storage for a particular Web Site. It allows you to store,
      read, add, modify, and delete data items for that domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data is stored with no expiration date, and will not be deleted when the browser is closed. The data will be
      available for days, weeks, and years.
    </p>
    <h3>The setItem() Method</h3>
    <p>The localStorage.setItem() method stores a data item in a storage. It takes a name and a value as parameters:</p>

    <h3>The getItem() Method</h3>
    <p>The localStorage.getItem() method retrieves a data item from the storage. It takes a name as parameter:</p>

    <h3>The sessionStorage Object</h3>
    <p>
      The sessionStorage object is identical to the localStorage object. The difference is that the sessionStorage
      object stores data for one session. The data is deleted when the browser is closed.
